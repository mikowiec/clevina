### Available Scripts

- `npm start`
  - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm test`
  - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`
  - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. App is ready to be deployed.
  - See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
- `npm run eject`
  - This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
  - Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
  - You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
